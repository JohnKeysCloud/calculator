A simple calculator written in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript, built for <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.

### Notes
I wanted to keep the UX/UI clean and straightforward with a minimal, yet modern aesthetic. My favorite part of authoring this project was creating the animation that is triggered if the calculation results in Infinity.
